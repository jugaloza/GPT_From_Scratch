# GPT_From_Scratch

## Problem:

### I wanted to better understand how GPT models function, so I decided to implement the GPT architecture from scratch. This involves building a transformer-based model, which uses attention mechanisms to process and generate text.
### Approach:

### The GPT model consists of the following components:

###   Embedding Layer:
###        Converts token ids into dense vector representations, allowing the model to understand words in a continuous space.

###    Positional Encoding:
###        Since the transformer architecture doesn't inherently capture word order, positional encodings are added to token embeddings to provide information about the position of each word in the sequence.

 ###   Transformer Blocks:
 ###       Multiple stacked transformer blocks that contain:
 ###           Multi-Head Self-Attention: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when processing each token.
 ###           Feed-Forward Networks: After attention, a position-wise feed-forward neural network is used to further transform the token representations.

###    Output Layer:
###        The final layer generates predictions for the next token in the sequence using a softmax function, producing probabilities for each token in the vocabulary.

### Model Training:

### I trained the model on a custom dataset using a causal language modeling objective. The model learns to predict the next token given the previous tokens in a sequence. The loss function used is Cross-Entropy Loss, which is minimized during training.

### Key Features:

### 1)   Scalability: This implementation can be scaled to larger models by increasing the number of layers, attention heads, and embedding dimensions.
### 2)    Generative Text: Once trained, the GPT model can generate text based on a given prompt by sampling tokens iteratively.

### ðŸŽ¯ Future Improvements

### While this implementation covers the basics, here are some potential future improvements:

### 1)    Fine-Tuning: Add functionality to fine-tune the model on specific domains (e.g., medical or legal text).
### 2)    Optimizations: Improve training efficiency by implementing mixed precision training or gradient checkpointing.
### 3)    Multi-GPU Support: Scale the model for distributed training across multiple GPUs.
